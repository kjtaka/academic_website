I am a doctoral candidate in psychology at the University of Michigan. My [research](research.html) examines (a) the cues people use to gauge what others think about stigmatized groups and (b) the impact this has on how they attend to and process stigma-relevant persuasive messages (e.g. messages about information about discrimination, inequality, and diversity).
