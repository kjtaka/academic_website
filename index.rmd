I am a doctoral candidate in psychology at the University of Michigan. My research examines (a) the cues people use to gauge what others think about stigmatized groups and (b) the impact this has on how they attend to and process stigma-relevant persuasive messages (e.g. messages about information about discrimination, inequality, and diversity).
